### SUN Gazing
❗When To Watch Sun <br/>
❗Check Sunrice and sunsetting Time in your area in internet<br/>
❗Watch sun daily 10 min Just watch <br/> 
❗Then watch Just 10min after sunrise and 10min Before Sunset<br/>
😄 If sun coverd by cloud or you have not waken up or evening you may be in travel Dont worry Sun will Come Daily ❗<br/>
❗Main Idea is watch sun only 10min that too sunrise and sunset timings not other time its very ✖️ dangerous to watch (gazing) during day<br/>
❗watching few times few sec during day is differrent from Gaing (Watching focusing continually on sun) Thats why timing is important<br/>

### Moon Gazing
😅 No timing Just moon has to come you should have free timing<br/>
Watch 10 min or even more no harm<br/> 
Only check your sroundings<br/>
