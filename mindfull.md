Then what to do for Bad happend from others<br/>
Pary GOD how to Solve that issues GOD may guide , so getting guideance from GOD work hard to over come the issue<br/>

### Yoga
Do daily yoga at least 10 min <br/>
Else do any excersise as per your comfort<br/>
Else Do atleast meditation 10 min<br/> Meditation is just watching your mind , watching your thoghts, Lot of Thoughts Lot of Distrubance will arise <br/>
in mind do nothing YES just simply watch the mind like security without controlling<br/>Actually you cant controll too<br/>

### SUN Gazing
❗When To Watch Sun <br/>
❗Check Sunrice and sunsetting Time in your area in internet<br/>
❗Watch sun daily 10 min Just watch <br/> 
❗Then watch Just 10min after sunrise and 10min Before Sunset<br/>
😄 If sun coverd by cloud or you have not waken up or evening you may be in travel Dont worry Sun will Come Daily ❗<br/>
❗Main Idea is watch sun only 10min that too sunrise and sunset timings not other time its very ✖️ dangerous to watch (gazing) during day<br/>
❗watching few times few sec during day is differrent from Gaing (Watching focusing continually on sun) Thats why timing is important<br/>

### Moon Gazing
😅 No timing Just moon has to come you should have free timing<br/>
Watch 10 min or even more no harm<br/> 
Only check your sroundings<br/>
